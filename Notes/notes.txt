- Jupyter notebook is a way to run code interactively in web browser alongside visualization and markdown text to explain the process of whats going on.

-  When we discuss IPython, we talk about two fundamental roles:
1. Terminal IPython as the familiar REPL
2. The IPython kernel that provides computation and communication with the frontend interfaces, like the notebook

- Jupyter Notebook and its flexible interface extends the notebook beyond code to visualization, multimedia, collaboration, and more.


- IPython provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with:
1. A powerful interactive shell.
2. A kernel for Jupyter.
3. Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.
4. Flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into your own projects.
5. Easy to use, high performance tools for parallel computing.
