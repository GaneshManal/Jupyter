I am in the process of defining a long term and ongoing project for both of you. In the interim (i.e. next 2 weeks), I want you to develop samples in Jypter Notes using iPython and explain me along the way.
 
This is becoming a very important aspect of all data science products and projects.  It is quite likely that our next project will use a lot of these concepts.

Let us start in the following order:
1.  Set up Jypter notes locally
2.  What is the flow it uses to create charts? â€“ where is the data set? How is code embedded? How is it invoked?
3.  Create simple examples and gradually increase complexity
